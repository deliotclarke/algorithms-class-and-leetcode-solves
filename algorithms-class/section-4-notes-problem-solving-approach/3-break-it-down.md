### Break it down

Write yourself notes or comments about what you're planning to do.

Explicitly write out your steps to force yourself think about your code before you start writing it - this may help find questions you haven't asked yourself yet, or highlight what you're unsure of.

Write a function that takes in a string and returns counts of each character in the string:

```javascript
function charCount(str) {
  //make object to return at end
  //loop over string
  ////if the char is a number/letter and a key in our object add 1 to count
  ////if the char is a number/letter and isn't in our object add it and set value to 1
  ////if char is something else (space, period, etc) don't do anything
  //return object
}
```
