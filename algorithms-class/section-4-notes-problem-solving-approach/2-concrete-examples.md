Write a function that takes in a string and returns counts of each character in the string:

```javascript
charCount('aaaa'); // {a: 4}
charCount('hello'); // {h: 1, e: 1, l: 2, o: 1}
```

- Should it include all letters?

"my phone number is 1897839"
"Hello hi"

- What if there are numbers in the string? What about spaces? What about upper and lower case?

""

- What if it's an empty string or nothing? What should be returned?
