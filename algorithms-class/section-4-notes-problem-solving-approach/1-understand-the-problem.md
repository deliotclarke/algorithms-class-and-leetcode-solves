### Understand the problem

"Solve the problem, then write the code" -my sticky note on my wall

- Can you restate the problem in your own words?
- What are the inputs that go into the problem?
- What are the outputs that come from the problem?
- Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? Do I have enough info to solve the problem?
- How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem

ex. Write a function which takes two numbers and returns their sum

- Implement addition or add two numbers
- Are they integers or strings or floating points? How large can the integers be? Are they inside of a data structure or passed as two arguments?
- How should the sum be passed back? If decimals, how many decimal points? As a string? In a data structure?
- What should happen if we only get one argument? Error handling?
- Should I label them?
