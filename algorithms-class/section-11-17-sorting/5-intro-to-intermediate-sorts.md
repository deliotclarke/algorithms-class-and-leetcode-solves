### Intermediate Sorts

Don't be scared! (apparently)

There is a family of sorting algorithms that can improve time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n log n)
There's a trade off between efficiency and simplicity
The more efficient algorithms are much less simple, and generally take longer to understand
