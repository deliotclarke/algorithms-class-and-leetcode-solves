### Which Data Structure is best? (feels like a trick question)

Binary Search Trees
Queues
Singly Linked Lists
Hash Tables
Binary Heaps
Stacks
Doubly Linked Lists
Directed Graphs

#### What do they do?

Data structures are collections of values, the relationships among them,
and the functions of operations that can be applied to the data.

#### Why are there so many?

Different data structures excel at different things. Some are highly
specialized, while others (like arrays) are generally used.

#### Why care?

The more time you spend as a developer, the more likely you'll need to use
one of these data structures.

You've already worked with many of them unknowingly.

And for help in interviews, but keep in mind, VERY HELPFUL IN THE REAL WORLD

They all excel in different situations.

#### Examples

- Working with map/location data? USE A GRAPH
- Need an ordered list with fast inserts/removals at the beginning and end? USE A LINKED LIST!
- Web scraping nested HTML? USE A TREE!
- Need to write a scheduler? USE A BINARY HEAP!
