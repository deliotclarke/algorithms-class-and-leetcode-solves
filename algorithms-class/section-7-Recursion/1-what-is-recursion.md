### What is recursion and also WHYYYY??

What is recursion?

A process (or a function) that calls itself.

Why know it?

- It's everywhere!!
  - JSON.parse / JSON.stringify
  - document.getElementById and DOM traversal algorithms
  - Object traversal
  - We will see it with more complex data structures
  - It's sometimes a cleaner alternative to iteration
