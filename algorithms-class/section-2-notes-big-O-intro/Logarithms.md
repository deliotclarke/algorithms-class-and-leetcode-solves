### Logarithms

Log is the Inverse of Exponentiation

Logarithms are the pair of Exponents

log₂(8) = 3 ---> 2³ = 8

log₂(value) = exponent ---> 2exponent = value

O(log n) is much better than O(n)

Some SEARCHING algos have logarithmic time complexity

Efficient sorting algos involve logarithms

Recursion sometimes involves logarithmic space complexity
