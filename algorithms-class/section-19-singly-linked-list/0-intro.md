### Intro to Singly Linked List

#### What is a linked list??

- A data structure that contains a head, tail and length property
- Linked lists consist of nodes and each node has a value and a pointer
  to another node or null
- Sort of like a train

The term "singly" comes from each node only being connected to the next node. "Doubly" would mean that it points to the previous node as well.

#### Comparisons with Arrays

Linked Lists:

- Do not have indexes
- Connected via nodes with a next pointer
- Random access is not allowed

Arrays:

- Indexed in order
- Insertion and deletion can be expensive
- Can quickly be accessed at a specific index
